Implementing a movie recommendation system that makes recommendations for films based on
content-based filtering was the aim of this project. The algorithm determines how similar two films
are by using essential elements from each film, including cast, crew, genre, and keywords. The textual
content of these qualities serves as the foundation for the recommendations. Furthermore, experiments
were conducted with several machine learning algorithms to evaluate their efficacy in enhancing
suggestion accuracy.
